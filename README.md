# MachineLearning-SVM
This post includes my reflections and notes on reading Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective.<br><br>
The post illustrates the math of SVMs and includes an implementation in Python. <br><br>
The full post includes much more details on SVM theory that is helpful for understanding the code. See the full [post](https://ray-luo.github.io/2018/07/09/SVMs/).
